            My name is Tom Bonino, and I am working to begin a career in
            Computer Science.
          </p>
          <p class="elevatorPitch">
            More specifically, I hope to become a Software Engineer. A little
            bit more about me: I am a husband and father, as well as a Data
            Science Coop currently with Cummins-Meritor. I get to claim Oxford,
            MI as my hometown, and previously obtained a BS in Youth and Family
            Ministry from what is now Rochester University. In the interest of
            supporting a family better, I have been working towards a second BS
            in Computer Science, as computers were always my other passion
            alongside working with kids. I get to count Dart Container among my
            previous employers, where I was truly blooded in the "real world"
            and had a fantastic experience learning the ropes in Corporate
            America. Following my wife's work once her doctorate from MSU was
            complete, we now live in Clarkston, MI, and I have been pursuing a
            BS in Computer Science since 2020. To learn more about me, just
